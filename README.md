# Parser
I use beautifulsoup or some other Python packages to download language material automatically from a website. 

## Goal
- Test beautifulsoup4. It downloads html scripts. We need to parse the scripts and extract material. 
- Test librosa. It downloads audio recordings. 
- Find some Python packages that do the same thing as beautifulsoup4 or librosa. 

What I want to achieve, a commandline tool that I give it a link from pangloss website and then it will download the material, parse the xml and then save the data in my local storage. 
Don't ask me why I do not ask my colleague to give me data directly, because I want to do it this way, and I think I can :D 

ok.... I am not really familiar with Safari ....I cannot find the shortcut to get inspection ....
